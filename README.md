## My Config Files

These are my dotfiles for different applications that I use on my setup, I don't like bloat, I like simplicity and not having applications that are bloated and take up a lot of ram.

### (For people other than me):
I would review my dotfiles if you want to add them to your setup, do some research of course and read the config files too for the comments. Edit some stuff if you want, they aren't copyrighted or anything. But I encourage anyone to skim through dotfiles and even suggest some improvements to my config files if they want.
