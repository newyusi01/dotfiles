### Edit these scripts to your pleasing
All you need to do to change the app launched is change the execapp variable.

The firefox script is no longer used by me (since I don't use firefox anymore) so it has different variables than the other scripts.

The spawnjailedapps.sh script is no longer used by me either, added it here anyway aswell (it was meant to be some kind of "launcher" for the jailed app scripts, but now I use the XMonad direxec prompt for that).
